This is a project to test out using BeeWare stuff.  I'll add a few apps as I go along.

briefcase new     ...set up project template. can then edit folders and pyproject.toml
briefcase dev     ...run from source??  pip installs dependencies then runs app with local python 
briefcase create  ...makes application template folder. incl downloads platform support package (incl python), and dependencies into template
briefcase build   ...maybe some compilation. folder now has a runable application
briefcase run --app ng-beeware-test1
briefcase package ...makes installer
briefcase update [-d to update dependencies] [-r to update resources] ... after editing application
briefcase create/build [platform]  ...create different platform (can't do foreign desktop (or iOS if not on mac), but can do android anywhere

briefcase run will automatically do create and build if they haven't been done [with -u, will update before execution]
briefcase --help give options
briefcase run android -d @beePhone to run on android emulator called 'beePhone'

c:\Users\neil.griffin\.briefcase\tools\android_sdk\emulator\emulator.exe @beePhone -dns-server 8.8.8.8
